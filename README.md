# Hand Drone

Simple control system for the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 using a Leap Motion hand tracking camera


  
# Files
### checkStatus.js
* Run this to see drone data

### main.js
* Main file, run this with the camera already plugged in and there shouldn't be any issues

## Notes
 This is some old code that I forgot to upload a year ago, I don't really remember if there was anything too significantly wrong with it.

Make sure to check for any irregularities on propellers / drone body. A lot of second hand ones are dinged up and it can mess with how stable flight is. If you run into drifting or issues hovering try messing with the deadzone, yawTrim, and horizontal / vertical speed scale variables.
